### Audio
Spatial audio currently not loading without Firefox developer tools. Working to increase compatibility.

### Multiplayer
The database this project was built on is no longer active. As such, the multiplayer element of the space is no longer accessible. To play the multiplayer version, please include your own Firebase database in io.js where indicated.


This project was built in the final week of CS396 - ARVR Studio at Northwestern University.
